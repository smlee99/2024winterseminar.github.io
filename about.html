<p><big><i>How we run the simulation?</i></big></p><br><br>

It is easy to run a simulation, but much more difficult to understand the underlying principle.<br>

We will ask questions about simulation-related methodologies. For instance,<br><br>

<p class="question">
How the Newtonian equation of motion is actually integrated?<br><br>

How can we set the temperature and pressure of given system to be constant?<br><br>

What differences and similarities do the force field models have?<br><br>

What can be computed using MD simulation and how can we bring physical insights?<br><br>

Why do we sometimes use MC and sometimes MD?<br><br>
	
Can we model polarizability and reactivity in classical molecular simulation?<br><br>

Can we trust the simulation result?<br><br>

...
</p><br><br>
We strive to answer these questions and try to understand how molecular simulations actually work.
