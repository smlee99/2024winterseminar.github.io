<p> The MC method is based on the idea that a determinate mathematical problem can be treated by finding a probabilistic analogue which is then solved by a stochastic sampling experiment.
  Along with the MD simulation, MC method is widely applied in various molecular systems to sample the equilibrium ensembles such as isobaric ensemble, canonical ensemble, grand-canonical ensemble, osmotic ensemble, and even Gibbs ensemble.
  The main difference between MC and MD is that although both methods are aimed to generate a trajectory in phase space which samples from a chosen statistical ensemble, the evolution to sample the states of the system is made by integrating the equation of motion in MD simulation while in MC simulation, that is made by accepting or rejecting the chosen random walk based on acceptance criterion. 
  Although MC simulation is a powerful tool for studying the equilibrium properties of matter, it was progressively realized that 
  For instance, in complex condensed-phase systems, it is difficult to design MC moves with high acceptance probabilities that also rapidly sample uncorrelated configurations.
  These obserations clearly indicated that improved MC moves and algorithms were needed and in the subsequent years, the underlying methodological problems received considerable attention. </p>

<p>In this talk, I'll discuss the theoretical framework to extend the repertoire of useful MC moves that can be applied to condensed-phase systems. 
  The key idea here is to introduce the idea of expanded ensembles, which is a set of sub-ensembles linked by a coupling parameter.
  By changing the value of coupling parameter in an expanded ensemble, one can perform a random walk between the corresponding sub-ensembles and calculate thermodynamic properties with high acceptance probabilities.

  Lastly, I'll briefly show the way several integrators are implemented in OpenMM, which should be interested to most of us.</p>
