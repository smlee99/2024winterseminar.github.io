<p> The MC method is based on the idea that a determinate mathematical problem can be treated by finding a probabilistic analogue which is then solved by a stochastic sampling experiment.
  Along with the MD simulation, MC method is widely applied in various molecular systems to sample the equilibrium ensembles such as isobaric ensemble, canonical ensemble, grand-canonical ensemble, osmotic ensemble, and even Gibbs ensemble.
  The main difference between MC and MD is that although both methods are aimed to generate a trajectory in phase space which samples from a chosen statistical ensemble, the evolution to sample the states of the system is made by integrating the equation of motion in MD simulation while in MC simulation, that is made by accepting or rejecting the chosen random walk based on acceptance criterion. 
  Although MC simulation is a powerful tool for studying the equilibrium properties of matter, it was progressively realized that in complex condensed-phase systems, however, it is difficult to design MC moves with high acceptance probabilities that also rapidly sample uncorrelated configurations.
  These obserations clearly indicated that improved MC moves and algorithms were needed and in the subsequent years, the underlying methodological problems received considerable attention. </p>

<p>In this talk, I'll discuss the history of the development of integrators in MD simulation community by focusing on the desirable properties that integrators should satisfy.
  Such properties include the long time step, numerically stable, and accurate configuration/dynamics sampling through simulation.
  To extend the time step used in integrators, I'll explain the constraint algorithm[1-3],  multistep integrator[4-5], and hydrogen mass repartitioning(HMR)[6].
  To ensure the numerical stability of integrators, I'll explain the energy- drift [7] and resonance instabilities [8] issue and how such problems have been resolved through the improvement of integration algorithms.
  To integrate in a reliable manner, I'll explain the dependence of integrators on configurational sampling [9] and dynamic properties [10] of intersted system.
  Lastly, I'll briefly show the way several integrators are implemented in OpenMM, which should be interested to most of us.</p>
