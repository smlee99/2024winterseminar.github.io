<p> Statistical mechanics is a study that deals with the possible energy distribution that a system can have in a certain state.
  The energy distribution is called the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which means that the average speed of each particle is based on their mass and temperature.
  In order to observe and measure the energy of the system, we can organize the system using thermodynamic variables that can actually be controlled. 
  Representative examples include Canonical Ensemble and Isothermal-Isobaric ensemble. 
  In both ensembles, observations are conducted at a set temperature, and in MD, a thermostat is used to fix the temperature. </p>

<p>Temperature control algorithms using thermostats can be divided into strong coupling methods, weak coupling methods, stochastic methods, and extended system dynamics.[1][2]
  Topics covered in more depth in this presentation include stochastic methods that randomly apply the new speed of each atom based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and better kinetics by applying temperature as an artificial variable called “heat bath mass” rather than a random element[4].
  Extended system thermostats that can explain and dynamics, strong coupling methods and weak coupling methods that can be distinguished according to the strength of interaction between each atom are discussed with formulas, and the unique strengths and weaknesses of these temperature control algorithms are discussed.
  We plan to deal with it.
  In addition, due to problems related to the thermostat, when using the velocity rescaling technique, the motion of the center-of-mass does not take into account high-frequency motion at all, and when only one thermostat is used, the kinetic energy exchange between solvent and solute is too slow.
  When using the Berendsen weak coupling thermostat in REMD simulation, there was also the problem of the Berendsen thermostat not being able to solve the canonical ensemble [5], which is a situation in which correct dynamics cannot be considered due to too small a temperature gradient.
  These will be discussed [6]. </p>
